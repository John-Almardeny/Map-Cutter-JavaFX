# Map-Cutter-JavaFX
This Program shall help in cutting a given image (map) into visual regions by creating SVGPath (Scalable Vector Graphics) to represent each region. Then a Class Regions will be created at the end of the session containing all the regions and their attributes. In addition to some useful static methods to manipulate those regions.

This class will create variables with specific values to control the Position Translation (X & Y) of the regions, so they become fully resizable as well as they shall comply with the Size Changes of the Scene.
